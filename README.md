# SimpleEnvs
A collection of Reinforcement Learning (RL) environments which I have implemented as part of my research. Hopefully this collection will grow over time, and prove useful to others as well.

All of the environments here are implemented using the [SimpleOptions](https://github.com/Ueva/BaRL-SimpleOptions) framework, and they bear a strong resembelance to the [OpenAI Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) and [Farama Gymnasium](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium) frameworks. If you have used these previously, you should feel right at home!

Further documentation coming soon!

Many of the smaller, discrete environments (e.g. Taxi, Hanoi, Rooms) are designed to be friendly for use with graph-based methods. If you wish to construct a state-transition graph for an environment, you can do so like [this](https://gist.github.com/Ueva/aadbb0b396466ad2a16dc629ba924b45).
